# Todo React App

## Description
This is a simple full-stack To-Do list application showcasing CRUD operations. Built using React.js for the frontend and Node.js (with Express.js) for the backend, the app allows users to manage their tasks effectively.

### Features:
- **Add tasks** to the list.
- **Mark tasks as complete** without removing them from the list.
- **Delete tasks** when no longer needed.
- **Organize tasks**: Open tasks are displayed at the top (oldest first), and completed tasks are moved to the bottom.

## Technologies Used:
- **Frontend**: React.js
- **Backend**: Node.js with Express.js
- **Database**: SQLite (optional, in-memory persistence supported)
